# MusicNotes
A simple piano made in C++

This is a program that uses the keyboard to allow the user to play musical notes on their computer.
The keys A-K on the home row are used, while the keys above are sharp notes.
The number keys are used to change settings, like the octave of the notes and how long the notes are held down for.
The notes are played with the Beep() function.
